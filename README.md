# gnss-position-determination-using-ukf
Receiver position estimation using pseudorange observations from multiple satellites, fused with an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Observations were generated by simulating the orbits of four satellites and computing biased ranges to a moving receiver on Earth.

### dependencies
- Standard C++ libraries
- Eigen library for matrix computations

### Scope
The main objective of the project was to practice with C++ and implement a UKF in C++. This meant the simulation was kept limited to 2D. 
- The satellites all follow zero-inclination circular orbits with an identical radius. The only difference is their starting angle. 
- The receiver only moves in the x and y directions. The reference frame is the ECEF frame where the directions of the x- and y-axes rotate with Earth's rotational velocity.

### Future Work
- Expand simulation and state estimator to 3D.
- Add atmospheric effects to pseudorange observations.
- Make satellite clocks drift as well.
- Add noise to satellite position estimates.
- Add line-of-sight, such that the receiver can only use information from satellites that are in line-of-sight.

### Results
The figures below show the actual x position versus the estimated x position, the x and y position error, and the estimation error in the receiver clock bias. The pattern in the x position error and receiver clock bias are interestingly similar (I suspect that the random library uses the same seed there).
